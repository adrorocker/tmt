# 🧠 Trail Making Test (TMT-A & TMT-B)

A browser-based, interactive version of the **Trail Making Test (TMT)** — a neuropsychological task used to measure **processing speed**, **attention**, and **task switching**. Built for personal use and cognitive exploration, this tool runs directly in your browser with **mobile and desktop** support.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- It is **not a diagnostic tool** and should not be relied upon for medical evaluation.
- It is not a substitute for professional neurological or psychological assessment.
- No clinical guarantees are made regarding timing, error tolerance, or scoring interpretation.

## 📋 What Is the Trail Making Test?

The Trail Making Test is widely used to evaluate:

- Visual attention
- Processing speed
- Mental flexibility
- Executive functioning

It exists in two versions:

- **TMT-A**: Connect numbers in ascending order (1 → 2 → 3 … 25)
- **TMT-B**: Alternate between numbers and letters (1 → A → 2 → B … 13)

## 🎮 How to Use It

### ✅ Taking the Test Online

1. Visit the [TMT Web App](https://adrorocker.github.io/tmt/).
2. Choose between **Variant A** or **Variant B**.
3. Place your **index finger or mouse pointer** on circle **1**.
4. Click the circles in the correct order (1 → 2 → 3 ... or 1 → A → 2 → B ...).
5. The **timer will start automatically** when you click the first correct node.
6. The final node will be marked with a **"!"** upon completion.
7. View your time, errors, and feedback in the **Results Modal**.
8. Check the **Results History** screen to view past attempts, ordered by date.

📱 Mobile-friendly — just tap the circles on the screen.

## 🧪 Purpose

This test is offered for **exploring mental processing speed** in an abstract and interactive way. While based on established clinical formats, it is not meant to replicate them exactly.

- Inspired by standard cognitive assessments used in research and clinical trials
- Great for practicing attention, sequencing, and speed under mild pressure
