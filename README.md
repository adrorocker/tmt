# 🧠 Trail Making Test (TMT-A & TMT-B)

A browser-based, interactive version of the **Trail Making Test (TMT)** — a neuropsychological task used to measure **processing speed**, **attention**, and **task switching**. Built for personal use and cognitive exploration, this tool runs directly in your browser with **mobile and desktop** support.

## 📋 What Is the Trail Making Test?

The Trail Making Test is widely used to evaluate:

- Visual attention
- Processing speed
- Mental flexibility
- Executive functioning

It exists in two versions:

- **TMT-A**: Connect numbers in ascending order (1 → 2 → 3 … 25)
- **TMT-B**: Alternate between numbers and letters (1 → A → 2 → B … 13)

## 🎮 How to Use It

### ✅ Taking the Test Online

1. Visit the website hosting the Trail Making Test.
2. Choose between **Test A** or **Test B**.
3. Place your **index finger or mouse pointer** on circle **1**.
4. Move in order without lifting your finger or mouse (1 → 2 → 3 ...).
5. **Do not click each number** — just move over the correct circles in sequence.
6. The **timer will start automatically** when you enter the first correct node.
7. The final node will be marked with an **exclamation mark (!)**
8. When done, view your time, errors, and performance rating.
9. Check the **History** screen to view past attempts from the same session.

📱 Mobile-friendly — just slide your finger over the screen.

## 🧪 Purpose

This test is offered for **exploring mental processing speed** in an abstract and interactive way. While based on established clinical formats, it is not meant to replicate them exactly.

- Inspired by standard cognitive assessments used in research and clinical trials
- Great for practicing attention, sequencing, and speed under mild pressure


## 📈 Performance Interpretation

| Test  | Above Average  | Average Range  | Below Average   |
